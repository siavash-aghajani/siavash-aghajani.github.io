# what is it?
XGBoost is a strong machine learning tool for sorting or guessing numbers. Its name means "Extreme Gradient Boosting."

# how it works?
It uses lots of small decision trees. Each tree fixes the mistakes of the ones before it, so the final answer is very good.

# why should you use it?
XGBoost is fast and can handle big data sets. Itâ€™s popular in contests because it works so well. But you need to adjust it carefully, like setting how fast it learns.

# when it would be helpfull?
XGBoost is used in places like online stores or sports to predict sales or game results.
