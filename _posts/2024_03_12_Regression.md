# what is it?
Regression is a way to guess numbers in machine learning. For example, if you want to know how much a toy costs based on its size or brand, regression can help.

# how it works
It looks at your data and finds a pattern to make a math rule. The easiest type is linear regression, which draws a straight line to guess numbers.
Other types can follow wavy patterns.

# when it would be helpfull?
Regression is used in shops, schools, and sports. The goal is to make guesses close to the real numbers. You need good and clean data, or the guesses might be wrong.
